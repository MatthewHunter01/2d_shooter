# 2d_shooter
Can you survive the Hoard? Play this 2D shooter and see how long you can live.  

My project is a 2D shooter where the player moves up and down as a hoard of zombies approaches. Lives are lost if a zombie hits the player or reaches the "Camp", thats the right side of the screen. After starting the game the player is prompted to press the play button and start the hoard marching forawrd.

Controls:
Up - Arrow: moves player up
Down - Arrow: moves player down 
Spacebar: Shoots 
Q: Quits game

My project was written using pygame and will need to be added before lauching the game. 

Project requirements: 
1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
2. Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code
3. Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.
